Welcome to SustainaCore AI Chat 🌿

This assistant was built with **zero financial resources** — just time, curiosity,
and open‑source software. It runs on a **free Linux VM with only ~1 GB RAM**.

Right now the chat is in **vector-only** mode (no heavy LLM), so it’s fast and
focused on what’s actually in the SustainaCore knowledge base.

What are you looking for on SustainaCore?
• ESG datasets or metrics?
• Project documents or guidance?
• How to get involved or contribute?

Tip: ask short, specific questions like “latest renewable targets in EU?” or
“upload guide for ESG datasets”.
