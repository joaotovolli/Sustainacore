            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The Tech100 AI Ethics &amp; Governance Index is a research index created by SustainaCore to assess how large, influential technology-adjacent companies approach Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance and ethics. The index is designed for educational and informational use and is not intended as investment advice.</p>

            <h2>Universe and inclusion criteria</h2>
            <p>The index tracks 100 publicly traded companies selected using a repeatable, research-driven process based on publicly available information and broad market relevance to Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled products, services, or infrastructure. The universe is reviewed at each rebalance.</p>

            <h2>Scoring framework: AI Governance &amp; Ethics Score (AIGES)</h2>
            <p>Each constituent is assessed across five pillars. Each pillar is scored on a 0–100 scale.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Transparency</strong><br>Public clarity of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-related disclosures, governance reporting, and clarity about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used and managed.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Principles</strong><br>Existence and clarity of responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) principles, commitments, and documented approaches to harm mitigation.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance Structure</strong><br>Evidence of internal accountability, oversight mechanisms, and governance processes related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Alignment</strong><br>Alignment with relevant regulatory expectations and demonstrated readiness for evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong><br>Evidence of engagement with stakeholders (users, industry initiatives, research communities, civil society, and partners) on Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance and safety topics.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Composite score calculation</h2>
            <p>The AI Governance &amp; Ethics Score (AIGES) Composite Average is calculated as the simple average of the five pillar scores:</p>
            <p><strong>AIGES Composite Average = (Transparency + Ethical Principles + Governance Structure + Regulatory Alignment + Stakeholder Engagement) / 5</strong></p>

            <h2>Ranking</h2>
            <p>Constituents are ranked from highest to lowest by AIGES Composite Average. Where scores are tied, a deterministic tie-break approach is applied to ensure ranking stability.</p>

            <h2>Weighting</h2>
            <p>At each rebalance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The top 25 ranked constituents receive an equal weight of 4.00% each.</li>
                <li>All other constituents receive 0.00%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This weighting rule is intended to highlight the highest-scoring companies under this research framework rather than represent a broad market portfolio.</p>

            <h2>Rebalance schedule and maintenance</h2>
            <p>The index is rebalanced on the dates published on the Site. At each rebalance, SustainaCore may:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>update scores and narratives based on newly available public information;</li>
                <li>add or remove constituents to maintain the 100-company universe;</li>
                <li>refresh sectors and metadata for consistency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data inputs</h2>
            <p>Scores and summaries are derived from publicly available information such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>company disclosures (reports, policies, governance statements);</li>
                <li>statements and publications from regulators and standard-setting bodies;</li>
                <li>reputable journalism and public reporting;</li>
                <li>other lawful public documents relevant to Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SustainaCore does not claim that any single source is definitive. When information is incomplete, SustainaCore applies conservative judgement consistent with the methodology.</p>

            <h2>Limitations (important)</h2>
