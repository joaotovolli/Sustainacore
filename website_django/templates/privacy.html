            </ul>

            <p><strong>B) Information collected automatically</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic technical data: IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, approximate location (city/region level), and pages viewed</li>
                <li>Cookies and similar technologies: used for login/session security and site functionality (see Section 6)</li>
                <li>Server-side usage logs: page views, API calls, downloads, and Ask2 chat metadata recorded with truncated IP and hashed identifiers for security</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We do not intentionally collect special category personal data (such as health information, political opinions, religion, or precise location).</p>

            <h2>2) Why we collect it (purpose)</h2>
            <p>We use personal data to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create and manage accounts and authentication (if enabled);</li>
                <li>provide access to logged-in features;</li>
                <li>operate, secure, and maintain the Site;</li>
                <li>respond to messages, corrections requests, and complaints;</li>
                <li>improve the Site (analytics and performance monitoring);</li>
                <li>prevent abuse, scraping, fraud, or security incidents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3) Legal basis (United Kingdom / European Union style)</h2>
            <p>Where relevant, we process personal data under one or more of these bases:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Contract: to provide account access and user features when you sign up</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4) Sharing your data</h2>
            <p>We do not sell personal data.</p>
            <p>We may share limited data with service providers that help operate the Site (for example: hosting, email delivery, authentication, analytics). These providers process data only to provide services to us.</p>
            <p>We may disclose information if required to comply with law, enforce site rules, or protect the Site and users.</p>

                <li>Server/security logs: retained for a limited period for security and troubleshooting</li>
                <li>Analytics telemetry: retained for up to 180 days for reliability and product improvement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may request deletion (see Section 8), subject to legal and security constraints.</p>

            <h2>6) Cookies</h2>
            <p>We may use cookies and similar technologies for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Essential cookies: login sessions, security protections, and basic site functionality</li>
                <li>Analytics cookies (optional): understanding site usage and performance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7) Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data (for example: access controls, encryption in transit, and standard server security practices). No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>
